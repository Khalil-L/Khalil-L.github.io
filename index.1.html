    <th> <p>  My name is Khalil Lindsey and I currently attend Palm Desert High School in California. I aspire to be in the game design field. My current plan after high school is to attend Cal State Irvine after I graduate in 2020. After I 
complete my necessary courses, I am hoping to work at a small game design company, and move up to a bigger one eventually. The reason that I have chosen to join that field is because I feel like it is something that I will enjoy doing, and 
gaming is always something I've been passionate about.As of my juinor year of high school, my average GPA is a 3.85. A few personanilty traits that have been used to describe me are intelligent, self-motivated, and Creative. My intelligence and self-motivation can showed through my grades, and
the comments that I recieved on my report cards. My creativity is demonstrated through my hobbies. My hobbies include gaming, weight lifting, and playing music. I am able to play the drumset, french horn, and auxillary percussion in the my schools
marching and concert band.  One of my biggest accomplishments is acheivieing honor roll in high school. I acheived honor roll in my Sophomore year, and the second semester of my freshman year. I plan to get involved in volunteer work and SkillsUSA in the future.
I do not have a job currently, but plan to have a part time job soon, as I strive to be self-sufficient as much as I can.</p>
