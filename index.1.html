    <th><p class="AMP"> My name is Khalil Lindsey and I currently attend Palm Desert High School in California.    I aspire to be in the game design field. My current plan after high school is to attend Cal State Irvine after I graduate in 2020. After I 
complete my necessary courses, I am hoping to work at a small game design company, and move up to a bigger one eventually. The reason that I have chosen to join that field is because I feel like it is something that I will enjoy doing, and 
gaming is always something I've been passionate about.
