<p class="app"> This is my app which that I use for tuning my guitar. As a musician, I was inspired to make this app because I wanted an easy to learn, and straighforward tuning app. Along with the guitar sounds, I added a looping bassline to keep tempo
I also added a text to speech button just for fun. I plan to improve on my app the future, by letting you choose different instruments and tempos for the bassline. The bassline was a difficult function to create, when using thunkable, the 
option to mute the volume was not working correctly. To solve this problem, I set the app to put the bassline volume to 0 when the mute button was toggled, and to increase it when it was toggled. The only other difficulty I had with the app 
was finding the sound effects and assigning them to to correct buttons in the correct order, but in the end I think it turned out well. I made this app using the block coding software named "thunkable". To do this,
made buttons that had sound attached to them, and was as simple as that. I feel that this app will be useful to people who aspire to be musicians, or
learn the basics of guitar.</p>
