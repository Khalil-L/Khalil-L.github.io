<p class="app"> This is my app which that I use for tuning my guitar. As a musician, I was inspired to make this app because I wanted an easy to learn, and straighforward tuning app. Along with the guitar sounds, I added a looping bassline to keep tempo
I also added a text to speech button just for fun. I plan to improve on my app the future, by letting you choose different instruments and tempos for the bassline. I made this app using the block coding software named "thunkable". To do this,
made buttons that had sound attached to them, and was as simple as that.  </p>
