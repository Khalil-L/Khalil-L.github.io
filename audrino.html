When we started this project, we decided to go for something simple. So, we decided to make a blinking light that turns on and off on a consistent pattern. One of the main difficulties that we had with the project was the wiring. Originally, 
the light would not turn on at all. After rewiring the board, we realized one of the wires was broken. The light was able to turn on now. However, the light would not blink. After trying multiple example codes in the audrino software, we figured
it out and the light was blinking. I independently wired the board, and my partner ended up finding the the right code to allow the light to blink and work as intended. Another difficulty
we encountered involved a button. We origininally intended for the light to be toggled by a button, but we could not figure out how to set it up and decided to let it blink on it's own.
