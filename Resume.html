<p> As of my junior year in high school, and event long before that, I have always wanted to get into the field of game design. I have been attending
Palm Desert High School in Palm Desert, California, and taking classes to prepare for my major in college. So far, I have taken a photography class, to
help me get familiar with working with computer design software, in this case, I used Adobe Photoshop 7. In my sophomore year, I took Intro to Science
technology, I felt that this would give me a good introduction into working with numbers, calculations, and math. These are all very important to doing
digital design. Currently, in my Juinor year, I am taking Computer Science Priciples to help me get familiar with coding, and next year I will take AP
Computer Science Principles, which will let me get even more familiar with these softwares. I am also going to become a member of SkillsUSA for computer
science.</p>

<p> I have not had a job yet, I have however had marching band expirience, which required my to move large instruments, set them up, take them down,
load and unload trailers, set up and move props, and work as a team. I plan to volunteer at Martha's Kitchen in Indio, CA in the near future.
One of my biggest acedemic accoplishments is acheiving Honor Roll in the second semesters of my Freshman and Sophomore years.</p>
