<p class ="TA">Another project that I worked on was a text-based adventure, which I code with my partner Ian using repl.it. One of the major difficulies we had to overcome was the code looping and crashing the game. To solve this, we created a "blank" state
to send the program to when we don't want it to loop. Another difficulty we had was our original concept and changing it. Originally, we wanted to have a randomized combat system, but we couldn't figure it out in time. Similarly, you were allowed
to explore another dungeon hallway, but we had to cut it out because it felt too long. We developed this collaboratively, the story was written together, but the sprite cranberry sub-plot was coded and written by Ian, and I coded most of the 
main story independently. At the bottom of this page, you can test out the game. </p>
