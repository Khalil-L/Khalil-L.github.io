My partner and I used Python to create a game. We chose Nim to be our game. One of the first difficulties we had encountered was the bot we coded. To code this, we had to look up an algorithm to win nim, then add variables to each pile, and 
give each stone per pile a number value, which allowed us to get the bot working. One of the best opprotunites we had during this project was the multiple menu screens. It allowed us to almost have a user interface, but it was made in ASCII
art. It makes the program feel like an old, text based adventure game. The random message generator was coded by me. To code it, I assigned multiple variables to multiple messages, and had them be chosen at random. I gave it the name "messages"
and had each turn display a randomized message.
